rbtree
======

C implementation of red black tree, Python code to be added

Red black tree implemented by C, Ansi-style.
Referred to red-black tree implemented in Linux Kernel and red-black tree 
introduced in <Introduction To Algorithms>.

In Linux kernel implementation, rbtree node is embedded in a larger structure, also it is user's duty to insert a node into the proper place of tree, search a node, create and free tree.

I changed it to a more convenient way to use for user mode program.
