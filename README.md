rbtree
======

c implementation of red black tree, Python code to be added

Red black tree implemented by C, Ansi-style
Referred to red-black tree implemented in Linux Kernel and red-black tree
introduced in <Introduction To Algorithms>

In Linux kernel implementation, rbtree node is embedded in a larger struct, also
it is user's duty to insert a node into the proper place of tree, create and free tree.

I changed it to a more convenient way to use for user mode program.
